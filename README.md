# Integration of TOPPRA in HPP

This package was kick-started from the [TOPPRA plugin](https://github.com/humanoid-path-planner/hpp-core/tree/master/plugins) in [hpp-core](https://github.com/humanoid-path-planner/hpp-core).

## Instruction for developers

### Unit tests

At the moment, there is no CI pipeline so developpers should make sure the unit test passes
before submitting a PR.

### Increase the version number

Inreasing the version number is done with `bump2version`.
Run `bump2version (major|minor|patch)` depending on the version number you wish to increase.
